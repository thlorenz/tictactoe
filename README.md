# TicTacToe

A [TicTacToe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game that runs on the
[Solana](https://solana.com/) blockchain.

It is built using the _MetaStack_ consisting of the following tools:

- [shank](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/shank) which extracts IDL data from the Rust
  program
- [solita](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/solita) which generates a TypeScript SDK from
  the extrated IDL
- [amman](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/amman) which allows debugging and testing the
  program on a local validator
